# MounderTweaks
### A bunch of vanilla-style tweaks and changes to Minecraft 1.16.2, with the help of the Fabric Loader.
Developed by mounderfod (aka redcreeper14385)
### Features
#### Shovel Grinding
Right-click with a shovel to turn cobblestone to gravel, and gravel to sand. <br>
#### Explosive and Fiery Fuel
Gunpowder and Blaze Rods can be used as a furnace fuel, smelting six items each. Somewhat inspired by tfarecnim's hilarious Blast Processing mod (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blast-processing)
#### Useful Poisonous Potatoes
Poisonous potatoes can now be composted, with a 10% chance to increase the compost level by one!
#### Coordinates Grabber (client-side)
Just press F6 and your coordinates will appear in the chat! Unfortunately, for technical reasons this cannot be switched off, but you can always unbind the key.
#### Lava Glass (off by default)
When lava touches sand, the sand turns to glass! Note: This is off by default because it can unintentionally mess with worldgen, i.e. lava pools spawning next to sand blocks. You can switch it on if you like it.
#### Colourful Sheep
Sheep of all colours can spawn naturally!
#### No Potion Glint (off by default) (client-side)
Potions no longer have the enchantment glint.
#### Better Bamboo (client-side)
Bamboo performance is improved by making some changes to ambient occlusion.
#### Configuration
Almost every feature of the mod can be disabled and customised to your will, with an easy to use JSON file! You can also access the config screen from Mod menu. 
### Downloads
When the file is approved, you'll be able to get the latest download on CurseForge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/moundertweaks <br>
Until then, or if you prefer GitHub, just click "Releases" on the right-hand side of the page, and from there you can download the latest JAR.
